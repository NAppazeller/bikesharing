# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview:

The goal of this project is to explore the viability of a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. The data that will be used for the analysis will be from the CitiBike bikeshare program in New York City, New York during the month of August 2019.

## Results:

*Demographics*

* Based on the New York City bikeshare data we observed ridership is largely male and most rides are typically under one hour.

* We also observed peak ridership for men and women is between the hours of 7-9am and 5-7pm during the weekday.

* Subscription based rentals verses ad hoc rentals are significantly higher and again represents a largely male demographic.

* Riders in their 40s-50s represent the largest age demographic.

*Bike Statistics*

* The bubbles in this plot show the bike utilization levels. If a bike has a higher utilization level, it will be a larger bubble.

## Summary:

![(https://github.com/NAppazeller/bikesharing/blob/main/DesMoines.jpg)

We believe a significant portion of the bikeshare users are daily commuters that utilize a subscription for their rentals. This is based on the number of subscriptions, peak hours of operation and duration of the rides. It will be important to understand where in Des Moines the bikeshare program will be piloted, what is the standard mode of transportation for daily commuters, average distance traveled for work, and the male to female ratio for working adults in their 40s and 50s.
