# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview:

The goal of this project is to explore the viability of a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. The data that will be used for the analysis will be from the CitiBike bikeshare program in New York City, New York during the month of August 2019.

## Results:

*Demographics*

* Based on the NYC bike share data we observed ridership is largely male and most rides are typically under one hour.

We also observed peak ridership for men and women is between the hours of 7-9am and 5-7pm during the weekday.

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

We believe these peak periods can be attributed to daily commuters.
